# Rudi

Rudi is a web app to help organise & encourage drum rudiment practice.

## Installation

Clone the repo, then:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Usage

Rudi presents to you the [40 rudiments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSC7iujjg_o) in a partly-random order based on which you most need to practice. Just log on and start practicing.

You can also use the app as a guest. In this case, you will not be able to save any tempi, and the rudiments will be presented in completely random order.

## Stack

React, TypeScript & TailwindCSS bootstrapped by Vite.
